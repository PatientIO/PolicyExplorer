<ol>
<li>Electronic PHI has been encrypted as specified in the HIPAA Security rule by the use of an algorithmic process to transform data into a form in which there is a low probability of assigning meaning without the use of a confidential process or key and such confidential process or key that might enable decryption has not been breached. To avoid a breach of the confidential process or key, these decryption tools should be stored on a device or at a location separate from the data they are used to encrypt or decrypt. The following encryption processes meet this standard.</li>
<li>Valid encryption processes for data at rest (i.e. data that resides in databases, file systems and other structured storage systems) are consistent with NIST Special Publication 800-111, Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User Devices.</li>
<li>Valid encryption processes for data in motion (i.e. data that is moving through a network, including wireless transmission) are those that comply, as appropriate, with NIST Special Publications 800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations; 800-77, Guide to IPSec VPNs; or 800-113, Guide to SSL VPNs, and may include others which are Federal Information Processing Standards FIPS 140-2 validated.</li>
<li>The media on which the PHI is stored or recorded has been destroyed in the following ways:</li>
<li>Paper, film, or other hard copy media have been shredded or destroyed such that the PHI cannot be read or otherwise cannot be reconstructed. Redaction is specifically excluded as a means of data destruction.</li>
<li>Electronic media have been cleared, purged, or destroyed consistent with NIST Special Publications 800-88, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, such that the PHI cannot be retrieved.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><em>Vendors</em>: Persons from other organizations marketing or selling products or services, or providing services to Catalyze. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Vulnerability</em>: A weakness or flaw in an information system that can be accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited by a threat and lead to a compromise in the integrity of that system, i.e., resulting in a security breach or violation of policy.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Workstation</em>: An electronic computing device, such as a laptop or desktop computer, or any other device that performs similar functions, used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI. Workstation devices may include, but are not limited to: laptop or desktop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), tablet PCs, and other handheld devices. For the purposes of this policy, “workstation” also includes the combination of hardware, operating system, application software, and network connection.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Workforce</em>: Means employees, volunteers, trainees, and other persons whose conduct, in the performance of work for a covered entity, is under the direct control of such entity, whether or not they are paid by the covered entity. </p></li>
